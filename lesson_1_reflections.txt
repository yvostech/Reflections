How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	I only had to view the lines that had been changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    If something go wrong I can return to a previous version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    Manually choosing when to commit gives more control but it is easy to forget to commit so it can be to many changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because a program need all files to function.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I first search all commits with git log and then with git diff a can see the diffrencis from two commits with git diff
    
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    If I do something wrong and I don't remember what I did I can always go back to a previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Save different states of my files when programming
