What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git create a directory and I have to inizialize to let git know that it is a reository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It only keep track of what happens an doesn't change any file. I can choose which files to add, maybe I don't want all files to be added.
